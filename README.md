# rag-eval-assistant

README content:

Purpose: Build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant that answers questions using a document corpus with citations.

Core principles: Auditability, measurable evaluation, reproducibility.

Planned features:

Document ingestion + chunking

Embeddings-based retrieval

Citation-backed answers (quote + source)

Prompt-injection resistance (basic)

Evaluation harness (quality, faithfulness, retrieval effectiveness)

Status: In progress (initial scaffolding).

Next milestone: Minimal working pipeline + first evaluation set.
