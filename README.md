# RAG Eval Assistant (Audit-first)

## Purpose
Build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant that answers questions using a document corpus with citations.

## Core principles
- Auditability
- Measurable evaluation
- Reproducibility

## Planned features
- Document ingestion + chunking
- Embeddings-based retrieval
- Citation-backed answers (quote + source)
- Prompt-injection resistance (basic)
- Evaluation harness (quality, faithfulness, retrieval effectiveness)

## Status
In progress (initial scaffolding).

## Next milestone
Minimal working pipeline + first evaluation set.
