RAG Eval Assistant

This project builds a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant that answers questions using a document corpus with citations.

Core principles:
- Auditability
- Measurable evaluation
- Reproducibility

Planned features include ingestion, chunking, embeddings-based retrieval, citation-backed answers, and an evaluation harness.
